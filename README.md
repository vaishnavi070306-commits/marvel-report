# Task 7: Create a Portfolio Webpage

For this task, I have created a **portfolio webpage** using **HTML**. The purpose of the webpage is to showcase my profile, interests, projects, and social media profiles in a clean and professional manner.

# Task 16:Data sheet report writing

## Introduction

The **L293D** is a dual H-bridge motor driver IC commonly used to control **the direction and speed of DC motors**. It allows a microcontroller or logic circuit to drive motors that require higher current than the controller can supply. The IC contains **two full H-bridge circuits**, enabling **independent bidirectional control of two DC motors**.

- **Package:** 16-pin Dual In-Line Package (DIP)  
- **Logic Supply (VSS):** 5 V, powers the internal control circuitry  
- **Motor Supply (VS):** 4.5–36 V, powers the motors directly  
- **Ground Pins:** 4, all connected to a common ground  
- **Control Pins:**  
  - **IN1 & IN2:** Set the direction of Motor A  
  - **IN3 & IN4:** Set the direction of Motor B  
  - **EN1 & EN2:** Enable Motor A and allow PWM speed control  
  - **EN3 & EN4:** Enable Motor B and allow PWM speed control  
- **Output Pins:**  
  - **OUT1 & OUT2:** Motor A terminals  
  - **OUT3 & OUT4:** Motor B terminals  

### Pin Logic

| Inputs | Enable | Motor Operation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| 0,0    | 1      | Motor stopped  |
| 0,1    | 1      | Motor rotates clockwise |
| 1,0    | 1      | Motor rotates counter-clockwise |
| 1,1    | 1      | Motor stopped  |
| X,X    | 0      | Motor disabled |

> **Note:** `X` can be either 0 or 1. Speed control is done by applying a **PWM signal** to the Enable pins.


## Internal IC Components

- The L293D uses **Darlington transistor pairs** to amplify current, enabling it to drive motors requiring high current.  
- Each motor channel has a **complete H-bridge**, allowing current to flow in either direction through the motor.  
- **Clamp diodes** are included internally to protect the IC from **back EMF** generated by inductive loads like motors.  
- Two H-bridges allow **independent control of two motors** simultaneously.



## H-Bridge Functionality

An H-bridge is a circuit that allows a motor to be driven **forward or backward**. In the L293D:

- Input pins control the direction of current through the motor.  
- Enable pins turn the H-bridge on or off, and PWM signals applied to these pins allow **speed control**.  
- The internal Darlington pairs increase the current capability of the IC, enabling it to safely drive motors up to **600 mA continuously** and up to **1.2 A peak** per channel.



## PWM Speed Control

- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** is applied to the Enable pins.  
- By changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the **average voltage applied to the motor changes**, which controls the speed.  
- This method allows smooth motor speed regulation **without adjusting the motor supply voltage (VS)**.



## Applications

- Robotics and automation projects  
- Embedded systems requiring bidirectional motor control  
- Educational experiments for motor interfacing  
- Small electric vehicles or conveyor systems
