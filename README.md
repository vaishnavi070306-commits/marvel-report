# Task 16:Data sheet report writing

## Introduction

The **L293D** is a dual H-bridge motor driver IC commonly used to control **the direction and speed of DC motors**. It allows a microcontroller or logic circuit to drive motors that require higher current than the controller can supply. The IC contains **two full H-bridge circuits**, enabling **independent bidirectional control of two DC motors**.

- **Package:** 16-pin Dual In-Line Package (DIP)  
- **Logic Supply (VSS):** 5 V, powers the internal control circuitry  
- **Motor Supply (VS):** 4.5–36 V, powers the motors directly  
- **Ground Pins:** 4, all connected to a common ground  
- **Control Pins:**  
  - **IN1 & IN2:** Set the direction of Motor A  
  - **IN3 & IN4:** Set the direction of Motor B  
  - **EN1 & EN2:** Enable Motor A and allow PWM speed control  
  - **EN3 & EN4:** Enable Motor B and allow PWM speed control  
- **Output Pins:**  
  - **OUT1 & OUT2:** Motor A terminals  
  - **OUT3 & OUT4:** Motor B terminals  

### Pin Logic

| Inputs | Enable | Motor Operation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| 0,0    | 1      | Motor stopped  |
| 0,1    | 1      | Motor rotates clockwise |
| 1,0    | 1      | Motor rotates counter-clockwise |
| 1,1    | 1      | Motor stopped  |
| X,X    | 0      | Motor disabled |

> **Note:** `X` can be either 0 or 1. Speed control is done by applying a **PWM signal** to the Enable pins.


## Internal IC Components

- The L293D uses **Darlington transistor pairs** to amplify current, enabling it to drive motors requiring high current.  
- Each motor channel has a **complete H-bridge**, allowing current to flow in either direction through the motor.  
- **Clamp diodes** are included internally to protect the IC from **back EMF** generated by inductive loads like motors.  
- Two H-bridges allow **independent control of two motors** simultaneously.



## H-Bridge Functionality

![WhatsApp Image 2026-01-17 at 7 02 57 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f9cd53-8d5d-46d2-8d97-a15ee49315a0)


An H-bridge is a circuit that allows a motor to be driven **forward or backward**. In the L293D:

- Input pins control the direction of current through the motor.  
- Enable pins turn the H-bridge on or off, and PWM signals applied to these pins allow **speed control**.  
- The internal Darlington pairs increase the current capability of the IC, enabling it to safely drive motors up to **600 mA continuously** and up to **1.2 A peak** per channel.



## PWM Speed Control

- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** is applied to the Enable pins.  
- By changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the **average voltage applied to the motor changes**, which controls the speed.  
- This method allows smooth motor speed regulation **without adjusting the motor supply voltage (VS)**.



## Applications

- Robotics and automation projects  
- Embedded systems requiring bidirectional motor control  
- Educational experiments for motor interfacing  
- Small electric vehicles or conveyor systems

  # TASK 17:Introduction to VR

## What is Virtual Reality?

Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that creates a **simulated environment**, allowing users to feel as though they are present in a completely different place or world. VR places the user inside a **computer-generated environment** that feels real and immersive.

This is achieved using special equipment such as a **VR headset**, which covers the eyes and sometimes the ears. The headset blocks out the physical world and replaces it with a **believable, interactive 3D environment** that users can explore and interact with, creating a strong sense of presence.

## How Virtual Reality Works

Virtual Reality works by using a **head-mounted display (HMD)** combined with **input tracking systems**.

- The display is split between the two eyes, creating a **stereoscopic 3D effect**
- Stereo sound enhances realism and depth
- Images are fed at **slightly different angles** to each eye, creating the illusion of depth and solidity
- LCD or OLED panels, combined with lenses, fill the entire field of vision
- Sensors track head movement and user input to update the virtual world in real time

Together, these technologies create an **immersive and believable digital world** generated entirely by a computer.

## Evolution of Virtual Reality

Although VR feels like a modern invention, it has existed in various forms for **decades**. Early examples include **360° panoramic paintings**, which surprised audiences by creating a sense of immersion long before digital VR existed.

Virtual Reality can be considered the **“wise mind” of the digital world**—it creates an environment that functions independently of the user while still allowing interaction. It offers first-hand experiences of events and scenarios, including their psychological after-effects.

This makes VR a powerful tool for understanding **human perception, cognition, and behavior**.

## Difference Between Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)

| Feature | Virtual Reality (VR) | Augmented Reality (AR) |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Definition | Creates a fully immersive digital environment | Overlays digital elements onto the real world |
| User Experience | Completely replaces the real world | Enhances the real world with digital content |
| Hardware Requirement | Requires VR headsets or similar devices | Works on smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses |
| Awareness of Reality | User is isolated from the real world | User remains aware of the real environment |
| Technology Complexity | Requires powerful hardware and software | Requires relatively simpler technology |
| Examples | PlayStation VR, Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive | Pokémon GO, Google Maps AR, IKEA AR App |
