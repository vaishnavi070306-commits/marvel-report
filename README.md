# Task 2: API

For this task, I built a small web app that shows real-time weather for any city using the OpenWeather API. I made it so I can type a city name and click a button to see the temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. I also added a feature to refresh the data automatically every five minutes so it stays updated. While working on this, I got hands-on experience with fetching data from an API using JavaScript and displaying it on a webpage. It was interesting to see how quickly I could make the app respond to user input and show live information.

## Internal IC Components

- The L293D uses **Darlington transistor pairs** to amplify current, enabling it to drive motors requiring high current.  
- Each motor channel has a **complete H-bridge**, allowing current to flow in either direction through the motor.  
- **Clamp diodes** are included internally to protect the IC from **back EMF** generated by inductive loads like motors.  
- Two H-bridges allow **independent control of two motors** simultaneously.


## H-Bridge Functionality

![WhatsApp Image 2026-01-17 at 7 02 57 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f9cd53-8d5d-46d2-8d97-a15ee49315a0)

An H-bridge is a circuit that allows a motor to be driven **forward or backward**. In the L293D:

- Input pins control the direction of current through the motor.  
- Enable pins turn the H-bridge on or off, and PWM signals applied to these pins allow **speed control**.  
- The internal Darlington pairs increase the current capability of the IC, enabling it to safely drive motors up to **600 mA continuously** and up to **1.2 A peak** per channel.

## PWM Speed Control

- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** is applied to the Enable pins.  
- By changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the **average voltage applied to the motor changes**, which controls the speed.  
- This method allows smooth motor speed regulation **without adjusting the motor supply voltage (VS)**.

## Applications

- Robotics and automation projects  
- Embedded systems requiring bidirectional motor control  
- Educational experiments for motor interfacing  
- Small electric vehicles or conveyor systems

# TASK 17: Introduction To VR

## What is Virtual Reality?

Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that creates a **simulated environment**, allowing users to feel as though they are present in a completely different place or world. VR places the user inside a **computer-generated environment** that feels real and immersive.

This is achieved using special equipment such as a **VR headset**, which covers the eyes and sometimes the ears. The headset blocks out the physical world and replaces it with a **believable, interactive 3D environment** that users can explore and interact with, creating a strong sense of presence.

## How Virtual Reality Works

Virtual Reality works by using a **head-mounted display (HMD)** combined with **input tracking systems**.

- The display is split between the two eyes, creating a **stereoscopic 3D effect**
- Stereo sound enhances realism and depth
- Images are fed at **slightly different angles** to each eye, creating the illusion of depth and solidity
- LCD or OLED panels, combined with lenses, fill the entire field of vision
- Sensors track head movement and user input to update the virtual world in real time

Together, these technologies create an **immersive and believable digital world** generated entirely by a computer.

## Evolution of Virtual Reality

Although VR feels like a modern invention, it has existed in various forms for **decades**. Early examples include **360° panoramic paintings**, which surprised audiences by creating a sense of immersion long before digital VR existed.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f13c1ca-36ee-47a0-98e1-753987f0adad" width="500"/>
<br><br>


Virtual Reality can be considered the **“wise mind” of the digital world**—it creates an environment that functions independently of the user while still allowing interaction. It offers first-hand experiences of events and scenarios, including their psychological after-effects.

This makes VR a powerful tool for understanding **human perception, cognition, and behavior**.

## Difference Between Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
